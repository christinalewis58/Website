Crochet A Day

Crocheters often have trouble completing big projects. The dedication and time required to make blankets, sweaters, and other lengthy items can be overwhelming without a system to practice daily.

Crochet A Day gives crocheters accountability and structure to help them feel less overwhelmed when starting big projects. The application allows the user to click a button to generate a random number of rows  from 1 to 15. The user will complete the specified number of rows the generator tells them to. 

For a unique experience, the user can also choose to use a different color palette each day with the Color Maker. This would create an entirely unique blanket with stripes of varying widths. If users want to crochet more than the generator tells them to, they can generate as many random numbers and colors as they like.

Technology

The application was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The Row Count generator was made with JavaScript using the math.Random function. For the Color Maker, I used Colormind.io, a third-party API. The app connects to the API and requests a random color palette of 5 colors. I created a blog using a mock database called Mockable.io.

Contribution

In the projectâ€™s current status, the third-party APIs only allow HTTP requests. Future development will focus on finding an alternative, secure solution to the color palette generator and the blog page.
